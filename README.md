# Plotter

Page for easy and acessible way to plot data saved in files (currently only .txt) organized in columns using Plotly.

Data should be organized in columns and separated with either a comma (,) a semicolon (;) a dot (.) or a TAB (  ).

Made for fun and for testing some beginner frontend development (HTML and CSS) and javascript knowledge.
